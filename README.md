# light_cycle
A coding game for beginner programmers to experienced veteran AI designers

Requires pexpect python library to run (because i am lazy :/) if this beecomes big enough of a problems I will make it work with out pexpect

To install pexpect:
pip install pexpect

The light_cycle.py has been tested on linux not windows. As far as I know it should work on both.

Call the server in linux with the format

light_cycle CLIENT_PATH CLIENT_PATH [GRID_LENGTH]
